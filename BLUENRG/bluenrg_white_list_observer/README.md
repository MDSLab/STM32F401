In this project we are declaring the GAP role of the Nucleo as that of a BLE Observer.
The Nucleo has a software defined whitelist which it uses to compare with the addresses of the scanned advertisement packet.
On detection of the desired BLE MAC Id containing advertisement, a specific action can be performed(like blinking an LED for example).
